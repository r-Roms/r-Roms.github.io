/**
 * A `Channel` is a nexus of I/O operations, which supports both reading and
 * writing. A channel may read values of type `InElem` and write values of type
 * `OutElem`. When the channel finishes, it yields a value of type `OutDone`. A
 * channel may fail with a value of type `OutErr`.
 *
 * Channels are the foundation of Streams: both streams and sinks are built on
 * channels. Most users shouldn't have to use channels directly, as streams and
 * sinks are much more convenient and cover all common use cases. However, when
 * adding new stream and sink operators, or doing something highly specialized,
 * it may be useful to use channels directly.
 *
 * Channels compose in a variety of ways:
 *
 *  - **Piping**: One channel can be piped to another channel, assuming the
 *    input type of the second is the same as the output type of the first.
 *  - **Sequencing**: The terminal value of one channel can be used to create
 *    another channel, and both the first channel and the function that makes
 *    the second channel can be composed into a channel.
 *  - **Concatenating**: The output of one channel can be used to create other
 *    channels, which are all concatenated together. The first channel and the
 *    function that makes the other channels can be composed into a channel.
